# Neural


## ‚ÑπÔ∏èÔ∏è Description
Neural is a framework dedicated to the realization of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in C++. A development environment is provided with Docker, everything is preinstalled on the image you just have to create your image and start working!

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
### Prerequisites
* Docker
```
git clone https://github.com/NicoBrug/Neural.git
```
## üîß How to install the development environment
Ok, first let's start by building the image (the development environment). 
```
xhost local:root
docker build -t neural .
```
Now we need to create the container. To do this we need to specify that we want to "share" the folder with our container. (path = The path to the folder where Neural is located )
```
sudo docker run \
    -it \
    --net=host \
    --privileged \
    -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v ~/Documents/neuralnetworks/Neural:/home/Projects/Neural \
    -t neural /bin/bash
```
Now we want to compile the project and check that the development environment is ready!
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Everything to compile without problems? Then you can go to the next step, run the XOR example.
```
./Neural
```

## :sunglasses: How to use

Create the network
```
Network net; 
```
or if we already save a Neural network :
```
Network net("../net.json"); 
```
Instantiate the different activation function :
```
Activation* than = new Than();
Activation* sigmoid = new Sigmoid();
```
Instantiate the different Layer : Fc_Layer = full connected neuron
```
Fc_Layer* fcl1 = new Fc_Layer(2,5);
Activation_layer* acl1 = new Activation_layer(than);
```
Add the different layer to Network :
```
Fc_Layer* fcl1 = new Fc_Layer(2,5);
Activation_layer* acl1 = new Activation_layer(than);
```
Train the network : 
```
net.Fit(x_data,x_train,1000,0.1);
```
Use the network :
```
net.Predict(x_test);
```
Save :
```
net.Save("My_Amazing_Weights");
```
