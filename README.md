## Description
Neural is a framework developed in C++ allowing the realization of artificial neural networks. It is intended to be simple to use and easy to install (Just create the Docker and start to code!). If you encounter any problem, don't hesitate to let me know. 
It's works with a docker image, which allows to quickly install and configure CUDA and OpenGL as well as the necessary tools for data visualization. 
To access the installation guide, API documentation and tools please visit the [Website](https://nicobrug.github.io/NeuralDocs/). 


## Exemple
### MNIST
Use of the stochastic gradient descent method with the mean square error calculation function.
